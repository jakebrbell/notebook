Intro to Programming

Code as a spoken language

- Declaration
    - When you declare a variable, it is just something like “var [identifier]"
    - If someone told you to “declare a variable named x, you would write “var x"
- Assignment
    - It occurs when you set something using a single equal sign
    - It is different from declaration but the two often happen on the same line
    - If someone told you to "assign (or set) x to one” you would write “x = 1"
