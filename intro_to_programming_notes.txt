Intro to Programming

Code as a spoken language

- Declaration
    - When you declare a variable, it is just something like “var [identifier]"
    - If someone told you to “declare a variable named x, you would write “var x"
- Assignment
    - It occurs when you set something using a single equal sign
    - It is different from declaration but the two often happen on the same line
    - If someone told you to "assign (or set) x to one” you would write “x = 1"
- Words
    - Keyword
        - Reserved words that can’t be used as identifiers.
        - Words like if / function / var / while / this / etc.
    - Identifier (or variable name)
        - A string of characters used for variable name, function name, parameter name, etc.
        - An identifier must start with a letter, _ or $ but the rest can be letters, numbers, _ or $. They can’t start with numbers
    - Operator
        - Almost like functions. They effectively perform some action.
        - Ex. +, -, /, *, %, >, <, >=, <=, +=, -=, /=, *=, ==, !=, ===, !===, &&, ||, in, instanceof, delete, new, void, typeof, ++, --
- Literals
    - They literally represent what they are (as opposed to a variable)
    - Examples:
        - String literal - “hello” or ‘howdy'
        - Number literal - 42
        - Boolean literal - true or false
        - Array literal - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        - Object literal - { width: 10, height: 12 }
    - Using the term literal can help to prevent confusion when talking to others about your code.
- Expressions
    - Anything that results in a value
    - ex. someVar or 1 + 1
- Statements
    - Blocks of code that do something
    - ex. a for loop, an if statement, variable assignment
    - In “var foo = 1 + 1” 1 + 1 is an expression, but the entire line is a statement
