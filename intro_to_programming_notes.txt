Intro to Programming

Code as a spoken language

- Declaration
    - When you declare a variable, it is just something like “var [identifier]"
    - If someone told you to “declare a variable named x, you would write “var x"
- Assignment
    - It occurs when you set something using a single equal sign
    - It is different from declaration but the two often happen on the same line
    - If someone told you to "assign (or set) x to one” you would write “x = 1"
- Words
    - Keyword
        - Reserved words that can’t be used as identifiers.
        - Words like if / function / var / while / this / etc.
    - Identifier (or variable name)
        - A string of characters used for variable name, function name, parameter name, etc.
        - An identifier must start with a letter, _ or $ but the rest can be letters, numbers, _ or $. They can’t start with numbers
    - Operator
        - Almost like functions. They effectively perform some action.
        - Ex. +, -, /, *, %, >, <, >=, <=, +=, -=, /=, *=, ==, !=, ===, !===, &&, ||, in, instanceof, delete, new, void, typeof, ++, --
